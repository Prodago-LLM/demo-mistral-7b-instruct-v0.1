Before determining the authentication options, a department should consider many factors, such as the use of mandatory services, technical requirements, cost, privacy and security requirements, and user acceptability. requirements)"
"Select authentication solution ; An ideal authentication solution would meet the minimum requirement in all three areas: identity, credentials and authentication. However, it may not be feasible or cost-effective for a department to implement an authentication solution using the standardized requirements specified for the assurance level requirement determined.  When the selected authentication solution is lower than the identified assurance level requirements, the following must be documented: - A description of the rationale for selecting implementation using lower assurance level (e.g., cost, usability, mandatory service, technical feasibility) - A description of the potential threats and vulnerabilities that might be exploited (including breaches) - A description of risk mitigation measures for identity, credential and/or authentication risks"
"Determine identity assurance level requirements ; Assurance level requirements are determined by completing the Assurance Level Requirement Worksheet. The assessment is based on the nature and type of the program and activities. By breaking down the possible harms into different harm categories, the worksheet helps assessors identify and understand the risks across these different categories. The assessment should be performed by the responsible manager. This person should have a detailed knowledge of the program, service or transaction. The assessment draws on this knowledge and is based on business or program-related factors, including the following: - The program objectives, including higher-level strategic objectives or strategic outcomes that program activities are intended to achieve. Consideration of harms could include the consequences of not achieving these objectives or outcomes. - The nature and type of program, service or transaction that is being assessed. Consideration could include the consequences of harms to program owners and managers responsible for carrying out program activities, services or transactions. - The clients, stakeholders and other interested parties that may be affected by harms. - Intangible or global factors that may be relevant, such as the public interest or national security."

"Implement compensating factors for residual risk mitigation ; Compensating factors are additional measures used during the authentication process to reduce a risk. Compensating factors may be used when part of the authentication process does not meet an assurance level requirement. A compensating factor is intended to mitigate the residual risks or to counter new (anticipated or unanticipated) threat possibilities. The use of compensating factors mitigates residual risk; it does not raise the assurance level. When implementing compensating factors, they should: - Be appropriate to the program, service or transaction context; and - Be dynamic and easily adaptive, particularly in a highly fluid threat environment (e.g., a public-facing Internet service)"
"Validate residual risk acceptance ; Risk acceptance should be: - Documented and signed off by the appropriate risk management authority, i.e., the level of management authority required for sign-off should be commensurate with the assurance level or the relative magnitude of the risk being accepted (e.g., Level 4 might require sign-off by the deputy head); - Appropriately shared among participating parties with respect to potential liabilities and consequences; and - Clearly communicated to all parties involved, including clients. Departments should also be prepared to describe how the consequences will be managed on behalf of clients who may realize the potential harms."

This will establish an overview of the overall risk picture, including a mapping of risks as acceptable or unacceptable based on the corporate business risk acceptance criteria."

"Establish a Code of Data Ethics ; A Code of Data Ethics should articulate how the organization understands the meaning of the data it stewards—now, and in the future. Codes of Data Ethics typically incorporate some variant of the following general principles: 1. Data elements are entwined with a real person – first do no harm. 2. The effects of DM are inequitable, including some and excluding others. 3. Ensure future data use is consistent with expectations & intentions of its originators. 4. Provenance & tools for analysis must be documented, because they affect how data is presented & used. 5. Be explicit about how the organization’s data practices do and do not align with context-dependent expectations. 6. Collect only the data required for the task at hand; less data is less open to misuse. 7. Data subjects have a right to know what data is collected and how that data is used and/or shared. Be open and transparent. 8. Aim to be a leader in data ethics for long-term success. 9. Prioritize design practices that promote and enhance transparency, configurability, accountability, and proactive interrogation of patterns in both training data and outcomes. 10. Welcome internal and external ethical review."

"Establish mechanism to raise ethical concerns ; Explicit governance of ethical data access and use is required. The ethical evaluation of access and use must include both the actual access and use as well as the data subject’s perception of how their data is being accessed and used. Furthermore, this governance must provide processes and protections for personnel who raise concerns about data access and/or use that runs counter to this perception."
Evaluate ethical data access and usage ; Explicit governance of ethical data access and use is required. Some best practices that support the ethical access and appropriate use of data include: • Embedding provenance information in the metadata to enhance transparency of data collection and practices • Providing individuals the on-demand (or periodic) opportunity to access to the corpus of data the organization holds about them • Revisiting consent • Communicating both legal and perceived consent to third parties • Proactive disclosure of the organization’s DM plan with specific provisions for data disposition • Resolving to collect only that data which are necessary for the task at hand
Evaluate ethical outcomes of data usage ; Explicit governance of ethical outcomes of data access and use is required. The evaluation of ethical derived outcomes must exist within the operating governance structures of the organization in alignment to a socially acceptable code of ethics.
